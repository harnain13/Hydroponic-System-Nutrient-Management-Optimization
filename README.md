- Gradient Boosting Model
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 0.000482
R-squared: 0.935
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.000388
- Linear Regression Model
RMSE: 0.000491
R-squared: 0.932
MAE: 0.000393
- Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) Model
Mean Squared Error (MSE): Approximately 7.92e-05

### Conclusion:
The performance evaluation of our models demonstrates their capability to accurately predict nutrient concentrations, with the Gradient Boosting model showing slight superiority over Linear Regression, and the RNN model offering us a promising alternative with its competitive predictive performance.

### Impact and Future Prospects:
With these advancements, we anticipate a tangible impact on indoor farming practices. The developed models facilitate dynamic adjustment of nutrient dosing for optimal plant growth and productivity and offer valuable insights into nutrient uptake dynamics. This contributes to the evolution of autonomous farming technology, enhancing efficiency, productivity, and fostering a sustainable future for food production.
